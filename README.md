# Hi, I'm Rua! CS undergradute student who is on a journery to learn.
To follow my journey you can check my GitHub projects called "Notes". These are docuemtneation of what I learned through out my CS journery. You can find many topics like DeepLearning, AI,and Algorithms.
My "Notes" projects are a combination of implementation, blog posts, explanation and jupiter notebooks. Feel free to take a look and give me more ideas on how to improve them! 
Along side my Notes, you will find my other projects here as well. They span a wide area of computing interfaces, IR-search engines, Machine Learning.
I am also highly interested in open-source world, always looking for ways to contribute and understand more.


### Feel free to connect me:
Discussions on CS is highly valued and appreciated!
