Hi, I'm Ruya ðŸ‘‹
I'm a CS undergraduate on a journey to learn, build, and share.
Check out my project "Notes" â€” a living archive of what Iâ€™ve learned so far in CS, from deep learning and algorithms to systems and search engines. Itâ€™s a mix of code, blog-style explanations, and Jupyter notebooks.
Feedback and contributions are always welcome!

Beyond Notes, you'll find other projects exploring computing infrastructure, AI, and more.
I'm a big believer in open-source and always looking to grow as a contributor.


### Feel free to connect with me:
Discussions on CS are highly valued and appreciated!
