# Hi! I'm Ruya, an inspiring Computer Science & Machine Learning Researcher

I’m an undergraduate computer science student interested in **theoretical foundations of computation** and their intersection with **machine learning**. My focus is on problems that require systems level thinking like modeling complexity, understanding the limits of current computational models, and exploring chaotic and probabilistic behaviors in neural networks.  

I enjoy building experiments with interesting hypotheses, open-source codes, and well-documented analysis. This space is both my portfolio and my research log.  

## Research Interests
- Theory of Computing (Automata, Turing, Gödel, Incompleteness)  
- Complex & Chaotic Systems in AI  
- Mathematics of Deep Learning  
- Probabilistic and Symbolic Models  

## Currently In Process Repositories
- *[Chaos in Neural Nets](#)* — exploratory experiments on chaos and randomness in DL.  
- *[Neural Automata](#)* — experiments training LSTMs and Transformers to learn grammars.  
- *[FET ML Modeling](#)* — ML-based device modeling, GAN augmentation, and benchmarking.
